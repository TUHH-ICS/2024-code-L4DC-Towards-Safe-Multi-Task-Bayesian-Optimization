# Towards Safe Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization



## General

This repository contains supplementary material and the code to reproduce the tables and figures presented in 

> J. O. LÃ¼bsen, C. Hespe, A. Eichler, "Towards Safe Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization", submitted to the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics and Control Conference, 2024

The preprint with supplementary material including proofs is available on ArXiv:

http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07281

The code has three main entry points, which are located in the `code` directory. Usually, the user needs to do some adjustments which are specified in the respective file.

1. `test_run.py` starts the optimization of a low dimensional problem with additional online generated figures. It provides a good illustration of how the algorithm works. In the file, the user can switch between a one and two dimensional problem.
2. `run_N2.py` starts to generate the data that is used in Figure 3 (a). The script needs to be executed repetitively with different disturbances.
3. `run_N5.py` starts to generate the data similar to Figure 3 (b) (only SaMSBO).

Note that running scripts `run_N2.py` and `run_N5.py` may take a long time.
After generating the data, the script `plot.py` can be used to plot a figure similar to Figure 3.


## Prerequisites
